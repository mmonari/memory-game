## Features

  

This memory game comes with several interactive features:

  

-  **Home Screen**: The user is greeted with a visually appealing home screen containing game instructions and a "Start the Game" button.

-  **Card Flipping and Timer**: Upon starting the game, the cards are briefly shown face-up before flipping over, with a 1-minute countdown timer beginning simultaneously.

-  **Dynamic Feedback**: The game provides feedback based on the user's performance:

- A **Timeout Screen** if the player fails to complete the game in time.

- A **Win Screen** if the player successfully matches all 4 pairs within the time limit.

-  **Restart and Home Buttons**: Options to restart the game or return to the home screen are available on both win and timeout screens.

  

## How to Play

  

1. Press the **Start the Game** button on the home screen.

2. The game will display a grid of cards, face-up, for 5 seconds.

3. The cards will flip face-down, and a **1-minute timer** will begin.

4. Click on any two cards to flip them over:

- If they match, the cards will remain face-up.

- If they don't match, they will flip back face-down.

5. The objective is to find **4 pairs** of matching cards before the time runs out.

6. If you win, you will see the **Win Screen**, and if time runs out, the **Timeout Screen** will be displayed.
